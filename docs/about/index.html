Although my title is so, I also take on other responsibilities depending on the situation. I have been involved as a Technical Manager, driving the product roadmap for ongoing product improvement and project delivery. I also perform periodic technology scans to evaluate suitability of technology adoption or integration for my organization. I am certified Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect, PSM I and PSPO I.</p><p>I also graduated from Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s Master of Entertainment Technology program. I had delivered innovative training applications utilizing emerging technology, like AR, VR and Magic Leap. Some of these projects have been featured on The Straits Times and ChannelNewsAsia.</p><p>In my free time, I enjoy self-improvement and reading. Reading allows me to experience the life and ideas of other people. It is like the closest thing to being able to live multiple lives.</p><p>From my self discovery, I realized I needed time to absorb the content and ideas from books. I needed to write down the ideas, so that I do not forget them, and it takes time before I can internalize the ideas, accepting, modifying or rejecting them. It&rsquo;s for this reason that I have a Book Summaries section, where I have put up some of my past notes about books I have read. It&rsquo;s messy and they are not meant to be complete summaries, but maybe you can discover something useful for yourself in there.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
