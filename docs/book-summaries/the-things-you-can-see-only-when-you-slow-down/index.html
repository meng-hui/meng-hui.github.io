<a class=anchor href=#notes>#</a></h3><p>When we are joyful, our heart opens up to new things. When we are in a bad mood, we can’t be open to new things, no matter how wonderful they are. Without joy in our heart, our progress in life is slow and uninteresting.</p><p>To keep doing your work for a long time, do not treat it as just work. View it as a source of enjoyment and growth. The road to happiness lies not just in finding a good job, but also in learning to enjoy what you are asked to do</p><p>What makes us truly happy is meeting someone who accepts us for who we are. Even if we are successful, we can still feel inadequate and insecure if we are made to believe that something is wrong with us. According to some psychologists, happiness can be assessed with two simple questions. First, do you find meaning in your work? Second, do you have good relationships with those around you?</p><p>We live among countless relations: family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc. Life is good when these relationships are good. Being happy by yourself doesn’t last long.</p><p>To cook something delicious, you need time for the ingredients to marinate. To build a lasting relationship, you need time for trust to develop. When you are dating, temper your enthusiasm. You may ask, “What is wrong with expressing my honest feelings? Why can’t I give her a gift and tell her I love her?” Your words and gifts will mean more to her when she is ready. Love her, not your feelings.</p><p>It makes sense that Scandinavia should be famous for furniture design, since people in a cold climate spend more time inside their homes. Similarly, Italy is renowned for designer apparel; it makes sense that people in a warm climate should pay more attention to how they appear outdoors. Where you live shapes you. Do you live in a place conducive to the pursuit of your dreams?</p><p>When purchasing something you will have for a long time, like a house or a piano, choose the best within your means, not something that will do for now. You might think it is good enough, but after a while you will regret it.</p><p>Keep your thoughts positive, because your thoughts become your words.</p><p>Keep your words positive, because your words become your behavior.</p><p>Keep your behavior positive, because your behavior becomes your habits.</p><p>Keep your habits positive, because your habits become your values.</p><p>Keep your values positive, because your values become your destiny.”</p><p>—MAHATMA GANDHI</p><p>When I look deeply within myself, I realize what it is that I really want from others: attentive ears that listen to what I am saying, kind words that acknowledge my existence and worth, gentle eyes that accept my flaws and insecurities. I resolve to be that person for those around me.</p><p>Some say they don’t really know what they are looking for in life. This might be because, instead of getting in touch with how they feel, they have led their lives according to other people’s expectations. Live your life not to satisfy others, but to fulfill what your heart desires.</p><p>You can increase your self-awareness by interacting with a wide range of people in a wide variety of situations.</p><p>When you look for a job, try to find out how long a company’s employees stay at the company. This is more important than the size of the company or the salary offered. If people keep leaving, then that says a lot.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div><script>(function(){function e(e){const t=window.getSelection(),n=document.createRange();n.selectNodeContents(e),t.removeAllRanges(),t.addRange(n)}document.querySelectorAll("pre code").forEach(t=>{t.addEventListener("click",function(){e(t.parentElement),navigator.clipboard&&navigator.clipboard.writeText(t.parentElement.textContent)})})})()</script></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li></li><li><a href=#notes>Notes</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
