I am certified Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect, PSM I and PSPO I.\nI also graduated from Carnegie Mellon University\u0026rsquo;s Master of Entertainment Technology program. I have created a Prison Yard Virtual Reality (VR) simulator, a Crime Scene Investigation VR simulator and a bus driving simulator. These projects have been featured on The Straits Times and ChannelNewsAsia.\nIn 2014, when Microsoft open sourced Roslyn, I created and open sourced the first Roslyn analyzers for Unity3D. At that time, usage of certain Unity 5 APIs would cause Garbage Collection (GC) frame rate spikes, which lead to a poor experience for the user. I wrote the analyzers to detect the usage of such APIs. Since Unity 2017, GC has become less of an issue. Today, Microsoft maintains an official set of analyzers for Unity3D usage.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/ideas/","title":"Ideas","section":"Docs","content":"Good ideas are hard to come by. And when you come across a good idea, you wonder why you never thought in that way before. Below in no particular order are ideas which changed how I thought about something. Where applicable, I will include the book I got the idea from and a brief description of why you might want to read it.\nProgramming #  Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.\nTechnology stacks and programming languages go in and out of fashion, but the concepts presented here are still relevant today.

It is needed for your body to rebalance chemicals/hormones.
