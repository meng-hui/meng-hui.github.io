This website is kept intentionally bare, a place to share ideas that I have found useful. I will update this site's contents when I find something interesting. 

This site is built with Hugo and the Book theme, for easy reading. And for me, there is nothing simpler than writing in Markdown, a single binary, git and hosting on Github Pages.
