I am a Solutions Architect and have created solutions architecture for large tenders for hybrid environments and on premise environments. I am certified Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect, PSM I and PSPO I.

I also graduated from Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Entertainment Technology program. I had delivered innovative training applications utilizing emerging technology, like AR, VR and Magic Leap. Some of these projects have been featured on The Straits Times and ChannelNewsAsia.

In 2016, after Microsoft open sourced Roslyn, I created and open sourced the first Roslyn analyzers for Unity3D. At that time, usage of certain Unity 5 APIs would cause Garbage Collection (GC) frame rate spikes, which lead to a poor experience for the user. I wrote the analyzers to detect the usage of such APIs. Since then, GC has become less of an issue for recent versions of Unity. Today, Microsoft maintains an official set of analyzers for Unity3D usage.
