Software and technology changes rapidly. I have noted below what I hope will still be useful in years to come.

#### Writing Clean Code
Very generally,
- use the package manager
- use dependency injection
- create systems/services/components along meaningful boundaries. Test them
- assemble them until you have your application
- use CI/CD

#### Personal Security
- Use a password manager. Don't let breaches expose your password to other accounts.
- Use 2FA where important

#### TLS Security
https://ssl-config.mozilla.org/

#### IOT
Not sure if you can trust an IOT device? Use pfSense to create a segregated subnet for such devices. No consumer router can do this.
