Good ideas are hard to come by. And when you come across a good idea, you wonder why you never thought in that way before. Below in no particular order are ideas which changed how I thought about something. Where applicable, I will include the book I got the idea from and a brief description of why you might want to read it.

#### Programming
Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman. *Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.*

Technology stacks and programming languages go in and out of fashion, but the concepts presented here are still relevant today. This is also a difficult book to read.

#### Human Biases 
Daniel Kahneman. *Thinking, Fast and Slow.*

Explanation of System 1 vs System 2 thinking. Good to know and understand situations where you might be biased and make bad decisions. 

#### Sales
Robert B. Cialdini. *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion.*

Why do so many salespeople and sales pitches sound the same?

#### Training/Fitness
Mark Rippetoe. *Starting Strength 3rd Edition.*

Why are there so many exercise programs/trainers that claim to be effective? Becuase most people are novices who can still quickly adapt to training stress. 

Why train to be strong? Strength is the foundation of all physical movement. 

#### Investing
John C. Bogle. *Common Sense on Mutual Funds.*

Investing can be easy. Spend less than you earn, start early, settle for average and stay the course.

#### Entrepreneurship
M.J. DeMarco. *Unscripted: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Entrepreneurship.*

Being an entrepreneur is tough. And nobody is going to tell you how to do it. Someone with a profitable business will not tell you the "top 10 tricks" he used to get his business to that level.

#### Sleep
Matthew Walker. *Why We Sleep.*

Sleep is important. It is needed for your body to rebalance chemicals/hormones. This book is about the why it is important, not the how.

#### Others
Below are some books that I find fun or that they contain many topics that don't fall into a neat classification
- Richard P. Feynman. *Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!*
- Fred Schwed Jr. *Where Are the Customers' Yachts?*
- Any book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
