# Small Giants: Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big - by Bo Burlingham

###### Date Read: 2018-11-29

### Notes

1) You have to choose some metric other than growth, ..., something you believe to be equally or more important
2) Kept private as much as possible. Not practical in capex high business
3) Is there a special meaningful context the business is in
4) Close ties with employees and community is very important to these kinds of companies
5) Succession and handover is tricky.
