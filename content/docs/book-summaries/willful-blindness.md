# Willful Blindness - by Margaret Heffernan

###### Date Read: 2019-01-01

### Notes

1) We like people similar to us. When trying to do something about it, become even more entrenched
2) Love is blind. When it is spouse or family, you will tend to not see the problems
3) Dangerous convictions - "No one likes to be told they've been doing something wrong all their lives!"
4) Under too little sleep, you do not function properly
5) Ostrich - choosing not to know. Choosing not to admit facts which contradict you
6) Blindly following orders from authority
7) Being blinded by your environment in a way that keeps spiraling down
8) Bystander effect
9) Out of sight, out of mind
10) Money beyond a certain amount doesn't lead to happiness
11) Cassandra - whistleblowers, people who see the truth, but are not believed
