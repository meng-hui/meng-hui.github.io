# A Guide to the Good Life - by William B. Irvine

###### Date Read: 2018-09-30

### Notes

Negative Visualization - contemplate the bad things that might happen. Lessens the impact when it happens. Remember not to take things for granted, to not get used to what I have now; that what I wanted before, I have now.

Internalize goals where you have control over the outcome.

Fatalism - to the past and present moment. What is past, is already fated to be, cannot be changed.

Occasionally deny yourself pleasurable things. Occasionally do unpleasurable things.

Examine what you have done and see if there are places where you can do better

Tranquility over fame and fortune.

Enjoy your wealth but do not cling to it.

Use humor to deal with insults.
