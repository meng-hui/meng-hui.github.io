### Notes

Book about email, internet marketing

Your business should create your own breakthroughs
- know your strengths and weaknesses
- thinks of everyone as clients, long term
- offer a free trial
- what is your unique selling proposition?
- make them an offer they can't refuse, provide guarantees, so your clients won't make the wrong decision
- provide a package deal
- do small inexpensive tests to gather information


- partner with another company to sell to their mailing list
- implement a client referral system, easier to generate more sales from existing clients' friends
- reactivate lost clients
- use direct mailing, marketing
- go after prospects not suspects
- trade (without using cash) if it makes sense
