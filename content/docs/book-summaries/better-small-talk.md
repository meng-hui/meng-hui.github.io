### Notes

Practice short interactions

Practice being emotional. Practice passage below

After climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight.

However, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen.

“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking around him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”

“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.

“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.”

“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.

“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them about.”

They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.

#### Conversational Stages

- small talk
- fact disclosure
- opinion disclosure
- emotion disclosure

#### Set the Tone

Less judgement, playful, relaxed.

Don't drop the ball. Give more details beyond the literal answer

#### Make the First Move

If you were lost, you would not hesitate to ask for directions.

- ask for objective information, or a subjective opinion
- comment on something in the environment, situation
- comment on a commonality 

Find Similarity - be prepared to ask 5 questions in a row. Mirroring. Or mutual dislike

#### Manufacture Connection 

- Recognition/Compliment
- Complaining
- Correction - state something you know to be obviously incorrect
- Naïveté - act like you’re on the cusp of understanding

The 1:1:1 Story

- 1 action
- 1 sentence
- evokes 1 primary emotion

Asking for stories 

- broad but with specific directions or prompts
- Ask about feelings and emotions
- Give the other person a direction to expand their answer into, and give them multiple prompts, hints, and possibilities
- If all else fails, directly ask “Tell me the story about…”
- add to the primary emotion being conveyed

Stories should not be stagnant 

Practice free association - come up with 6 related words quickly

HPM - History, Philosophy, and Metaphor

SBR - Specific, Broad, and Related 

EDR - Emotion, Detail, and Restatements

#### Compliment

- superficial things
- things they have made a conscious choice about

#### Ask better questions

- open ended questions
- find out the assumptions
- get all sides of the story

#### Build Thyself

- have multiple interests/hobbies
- something you are working towards
- say yes
- develop and share opinions
- avoid being judgemental
