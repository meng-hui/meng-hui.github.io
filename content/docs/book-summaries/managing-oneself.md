  - learn by writing
  - learn by reading and listening
  - learn by doing
  - learn by hearing themselves talk
- Do I work well with people, or am I a loner? And if you do work well with people, you then must ask, In what relationship?
- Do I produce results as a decision maker or as an adviser? 
- Do I perform well under stress, or do I need a highly structured and predictable environment?
- Do I work best in a big organization or a small one?

#### WHAT ARE MY VALUES?

To be effective in an organization, a person’s values must be compatible with the organization’s values.

Successful careers develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work, and their values.

#### RESPONSIBILITY FOR RELATIONSHIPS

taking responsibility for communication:

- educate the people you work with on what and how you do your work, what contribution you make and results they can expect

#### THE SECOND HALF OF YOUR LIFE

- moving from one kind of org to another kind of org
- develop a parallel career 
  - e.g. 10 hrs of work in a non-profit

Reason to develop a 2nd career
- setbacks in main career, but in his outside activity, for example, he is a success.

It is vitally important for the individual, to have an area in which he can contribute, make a difference, and be somebody. That means finding a second area that offers an opportunity for being a leader, for being respected, for being a success.
