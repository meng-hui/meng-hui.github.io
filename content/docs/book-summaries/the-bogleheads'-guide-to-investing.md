### Notes

How investing is different from most of life. The following do not apply to investing
- *Don't settle for average.* Strive to be the best
- *Listen to your gut.* What you feel in you heart is usually right
- *If you don't know how to do something, ask.* Talk to an expert or hire one and let the expert handle it. That will save you a lot of time and frustration
- *You get what you pay for.* Good help isn't cheap and cheap help isn't good
- *If there's a crisis, take action!* Do something to fix it
- *History repeats itself.* The best predictor of future performance is past performance
