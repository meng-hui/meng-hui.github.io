Four life positions

I'm OK; You're OK
- Healthy position - we're making progress

I'm not OK; You're OK
- The one-down position - I wish I could do that as well as you

I'm OK; You're not OK
- The one-up position - You're not doing that right, let me show you
- NIGYYSOB (Now I Got You YSOB)
- "Why do you always let me down"

I'm not OK; You're not OK
- The hopeless position - This is terrible, we'll never make it

Emotional Intelligence - go beyond being independent to being interdependent - maturity and self-acceptance, together with an acceptance of others in spite of their differences.
