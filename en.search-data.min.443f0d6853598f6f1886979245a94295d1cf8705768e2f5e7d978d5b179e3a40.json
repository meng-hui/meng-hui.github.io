Christensen # Date Read: 2023-10-20 # Notes # Strategy/Process # Priorities Strategy - balancing plans with opportunities Execution - allocating resources Priorities # satisfaction and dissatisfaction are separate, independent measures\ndissatisfaction - Hygiene factors are things like status, compensation, job security, work conditions, company policies, and supervisory practices.\nsatisfaction - Motivation factors include challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth\nProfessional unhappiness - money or hygience factors become the only goal.\nBalancing Plans with Opportunities # If you have found an outlet in your career that provides both the requisite hygiene factors and motivators, then a deliberate approach makes sense. Rather than worrying about adjusting to unexpected opportunities, your frame of mind should be focused on how best to achieve the goals you have deliberately set.\nBut if you haven’t reached the point of finding a career that does this for you, then, like a new company finding its way, you need to be emergent.\nWhich of these assumptions need to prove true in order for us to realistically expect that these numbers will materialize?” The assumptions on this list should be rank-ordered by importance and uncertainty. At the top of the list should be the assumptions that are most important and least certain, while the bottom of the list should be those that are least important and most certain.\nFind ways to quickly, and with as little expense as possible, test the validity of the most important assumptions.\nBefore you take a job, carefully list what things others are going to need to do or to deliver in order for you to successfully achieve what you hope to do. Ask yourself: “What are the assumptions that have to prove true in order for me to be able to succeed in this assignment?” List them. Are they within your control?\nEqually important, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy in the choice you are contemplating. Are you basing your position on extrinsic or intrinsic motivators? Why do you think this is going to be something you enjoy doing? What evidence do you have? Every time you consider a career move, keep thinking about the most important assumptions that have to prove true, and how you can swiftly and inexpensively test if they are valid. Make sure you are being realistic about the path ahead of you.\nExecution # Look at what you actually do rather than what you say you will do\nWhen the winning strategy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth but impatient for profit. It demands that a new company figures out a viable strategy as fast as and with as little investment as possible—so that the entrepreneurs don’t spend a lot of money in pursuit of the wrong strategy.\nRelationships # when parents engaged in face-to-face conversation with the child—speaking in fully adult, sophisticated language as if the child could be part of a chatty, grown-up conversation—the impact on cognitive development was enormous. These richer interactions they called “language dancing.” Language dancing is being chatty, thinking aloud, and commenting on what the child is doing and what the parent is doing or planning to do. “Do you want to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt today?” “Do you think it will rain today?” “Do you remember the time I put your bottle in the oven by mistake?” and so on. Language dancing involves talking to the child about “what if,” and “do you remember,” and “wouldn’t it be nice if”—questions that invite the child to think deeply about what is happening around him. And it has a profound effect long before a parent might actually expect a child to understand what is being asked.\nIn short, when a parent engages in extra talk, many, many more of the synaptic pathways in the child’s brain are exercised and refined. Synapses are the junctions in the brain where a signal is transmitted from one nerve cell to another. In simple terms, the more pathways that are created between synapses in the brain, the more efficiently connections are formed. This makes the subsequent patterns of thought easier and faster.\nThis matters. A child who has heard 48 million words in the first three years won’t just have 3.7 times as many well-lubricated connections in its brain as a child who has heard only 13 million words. The effect on brain cells is exponential. Each brain cell can be connected to hundreds of other cells by as many as ten thousand synapses. That means children who have been exposed to extra talk have an almost incalculable cognitive advantage.\nWhat job are you being \u0026lsquo;hired\u0026rsquo; for? # I wonder what job arises in people’s lives that causes them to come to this restaurant to ‘hire’ a milkshake?\nLike those milkshake buyers, you and your wife can’t always articulate what the fundamental jobs are that you each are personally trying to do, let alone articulate the fundamental jobs that your wife has, for which she might hire a husband to get done.\nIt’s easy for any of us to make assumptions about what our spouse might want, rather than work hard to understand the job to be done in our spouse’s life. Let me share an example from Scott, a friend of mine with three children under the age of five. One day recently, Scott came home from work to find a highly unusual scene—the breakfast dishes still on the table and dinner not started. His instant reaction was that his wife, Barbara, had had a tough day and needed a hand. Without a word, he rolled up his sleeves, cleaned up the breakfast dishes, and started dinner. Partway through, Barbara disappeared. But Scott kept on, making dinner for the kids. He had just started feeding them when he suddenly wondered, where’s Barbara? Tired, but feeling pretty good about himself, he went upstairs to try to figure out where she was. He found her alone in their bedroom. He expected to be thanked for doing all that at the end of an exhausting day at work. But instead Barbara was very upset—at him.\nHe was shocked. He had just done all this for her: What had he done wrong?\n“How could you ignore me after I’ve had such a difficult day?” Barbara asked.\n“You think that I’ve ignored you?” Scott responded. “I finished the breakfast dishes, cleaned up the kitchen, fixed dinner, and am partway through feeding our children. How in the world can you think I’ve ignored you?”\nJust then, it became clear to Scott what had happened. Indeed, what he did was important to get done, and he was trying to be selfless in giving Barbara exactly what he thought she needed. Barbara explained, however, that the day hadn’t been difficult because of the chores. It was difficult because she had spent hours and hours with small, demanding children, and she hadn’t spoken to another adult all day. What she needed most at that time was a real conversation with an adult who cared about her. By doing what he did, he only made Barbara feel guilty and angry about her frustration.\nThe path to happiness is about finding someone who you want to make happy, someone whose happiness is worth devoting yourself to.\nRelationship outsourcing # Know which capabilities are important to keep in-house and which matter less.\nresources - people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. processes - ways that products are developed and made, and the methods by which market research, budgeting, employee development, compensation, and resource allocation are accomplished.

Never outsource the future\nChild\nresources - material and financial processes - intangible. the way he thinks, how he asks insightful questions, how and whether he can solve problems of various types, how he works with others priorities - how a child will make decisions in his life—which things in his mind and life he will put to the top of the list, which he will procrastinate doing, and which he will have no interest in doing at all. Outsourcing in families\nAre the children developing from these experiences the deep, important processes such as teamwork, entrepreneurship, and learning the value of preparation? When we so heavily focus on providing our children with resources, we need to ask ourselves a new set of questions: Has my child developed the skill to develop better skills? The knowledge to develop deeper knowledge? The experience to learn from his experiences? The end result of these good intentions for our children is that too few reach adulthood having been given the opportunity to shoulder onerous responsibility and solve complicated problems for themselves and for others. Self-esteem—the sense that “I’m not afraid to confront this problem and I think I can solve it”—doesn’t come from abundant resources. Rather, self-esteem comes from achieving something important when it’s hard to do.\nWe have outsourced the work from our homes, and we’ve allowed the vacuum to be filled with activities that don’t challenge or engage our kids. By sheltering children from the problems that arise in life, we have inadvertently denied this generation the ability to develop the processes and priorities it needs to succeed.\nChildren Learn When They Are Ready to Learn\nWhen children are ready to learn, we need to be there. And second, we need to be found displaying through our actions, the priorities and values that we want our children to learn.\nThe theory of capabilities suggests they need to be challenged. They need to solve hard problems. They need to develop values. When you find yourself providing more and more experiences that are not giving children an opportunity to be deeply engaged, you are not equipping them with the processes they need to succeed in the future. And if you find yourself handing your children over to other people to give them all these experiences—outsourcing—you are, in fact, losing valuable opportunities to help nurture and develop them into the kind of adults you respect and admire.\nSchools of Experience # Is the job going to give me the experiences I need to wrestle with?\nSending Your Kids to the Right School - Encourage them to stretch—to aim for lofty goals. If they don’t succeed, make sure you’re there to help them learn the right lesson: that when you aim to achieve great things, it is inevitable that sometimes you’re not going to make it.\nEngineer opportunities for your child to have the experiences you believe will help him develop the capabilities he needs for life.\nFamily Culture # If you want your family to have a culture of kindness, then the first time one of your kids approaches a problem where kindness is an option—help him choose it, and then help him succeed through kindness. Or if he doesn’t choose it, call him on it and explain why he should have chosen differently.\nThat’s not to say that any of this is easy. First, you come into a family with a culture from the family in which you grew up. There’s a good chance your spouse’s family culture will have been fundamentally different from yours. Just getting the two of you to agree on anything is a miracle. Then add kids to the equation—they’re born with their own attitudes and wiring. Yes, it’s going to be difficult, but that’s exactly why it’s so important to understand what type of culture you want and to proactively pursue it.\nLife of Integrity # The only way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions in your life is to never start making them in the first place.\n100 Percent of the Time Is Easier Than 98 Percent of the Time\nPurpose # Likeness - The Person I Want to Become Commitment - Process for committing to your likeness Metrics - What matters when measuring your life "},{"id":5,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/the-things-you-can-see-only-when-you-slow-down/","title":"The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down","section":"Book Summaries","content":" The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down - by Haemin Sunim # Date Read: 2023-09-09 # Notes # When we are joyful, our heart opens up to new things. When we are in a bad mood, we can’t be open to new things, no matter how wonderful they are. Without joy in our heart, our progress in life is slow and uninteresting.\nTo keep doing your work for a long time, do not treat it as just work. View it as a source of enjoyment and growth. The road to happiness lies not just in finding a good job, but also in learning to enjoy what you are asked to do\nWhat makes us truly happy is meeting someone who accepts us for who we are. Even if we are successful, we can still feel inadequate and insecure if we are made to believe that something is wrong with us. According to some psychologists, happiness can be assessed with two simple questions. First, do you find meaning in your work? Second, do you have good relationships with those around you?\nWe live among countless relations: family, friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc. Life is good when these relationships are good. Being happy by yourself doesn’t last long.\nTo cook something delicious, you need time for the ingredients to marinate. To build a lasting relationship, you need time for trust to develop. When you are dating, temper your enthusiasm. You may ask, “What is wrong with expressing my honest feelings? Why can’t I give her a gift and tell her I love her?” Your words and gifts will mean more to her when she is ready. Love her, not your feelings.\nIt makes sense that Scandinavia should be famous for furniture design, since people in a cold climate spend more time inside their homes. Similarly, Italy is renowned for designer apparel; it makes sense that people in a warm climate should pay more attention to how they appear outdoors. Where you live shapes you. Do you live in a place conducive to the pursuit of your dreams?\nWhen purchasing something you will have for a long time, like a house or a piano, choose the best within your means, not something that will do for now. You might think it is good enough, but after a while you will regret it.\nKeep your thoughts positive, because your thoughts become your words.\nKeep your words positive, because your words become your behavior.\nKeep your behavior positive, because your behavior becomes your habits.\nKeep your habits positive, because your habits become your values.\nKeep your values positive, because your values become your destiny.”\n—MAHATMA GANDHI\nWhen I look deeply within myself, I realize what it is that I really want from others: attentive ears that listen to what I am saying, kind words that acknowledge my existence and worth, gentle eyes that accept my flaws and insecurities. I resolve to be that person for those around me.\nSome say they don’t really know what they are looking for in life. This might be because, instead of getting in touch with how they feel, they have led their lives according to other people’s expectations. Live your life not to satisfy others, but to fulfill what your heart desires.\nYou can increase your self-awareness by interacting with a wide range of people in a wide variety of situations.\nWhen you look for a job, try to find out how long a company’s employees stay at the company. This is more important than the size of the company or the salary offered. If people keep leaving, then that says a lot.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/12-rules-for-life/","title":"12 Rules for Life","section":"Book Summaries","content":" 12 Rules for Life - by Jordan Peterson # Date Read: 2023-07-10 # Notes # RULE 1 STAND UP STRAIGHT WITH YOUR SHOULDERS BACK # Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you’re not only a body. You’re a spirit, so to speak—a psyche—as well. Standing up physically also implies and invokes and demands standing up metaphysically. Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of Being. Your nervous system responds in an entirely different manner when you face the demands of life voluntarily. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe. You see the gold the dragon hoards, instead of shrinking in terror from the all-too-real fact of the dragon. You step forward to take your place in the dominance hierarchy, and occupy your territory, manifesting your willingness to defend, expand and transform it. That can all occur practically or symbolically, as a physical or as a conceptual restructuring.\nTo stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality (it means acting to please God, in the ancient language).\nTo stand up straight with your shoulders back means building the ark that protects the world from the flood, guiding your people through the desert after they have escaped tyranny, making your way away from comfortable home and country, and speaking the prophetic word to those who ignore the widows and children. It means shouldering the cross that marks the X, the place where you and Being intersect so terribly. It means casting dead, rigid and too tyrannical order back into the chaos in which it was generated; it means withstanding the ensuing uncertainty, and establishing, in consequence, a better, more meaningful and more productive order.\nSo, attend carefully to your posture. Quit drooping and hunching around. Speak your mind. Put your desires forward, as if you had a right to them—at least the same right as others. Walk tall and gaze forthrightly ahead. Dare to be dangerous. Encourage the serotonin to flow plentifully through the neural pathways desperate for its calming influence.\nPeople, including yourself, will start to assume that you are competent and able (or at least they will not immediately conclude the reverse). Emboldened by the positive responses you are now receiving, you will begin to be less anxious. You will then find it easier to pay attention to the subtle social clues that people exchange when they are communicating. Your conversations will flow better, with fewer awkward pauses. This will make you more likely to meet people, interact with them, and impress them. Doing so will not only genuinely increase the probability that good things will happen to you—it will also make those good things feel better when they do happen.\nRULE 2 TREAT YOURSELF LIKE SOMEONE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HELPING # We deserve some respect. You deserve some respect. You are important to other people, as much as to yourself. You have some vital role to play in the unfolding destiny of the world. You are, therefore, morally obliged to take care of yourself. You should take care of, help and be good to yourself the same way you would take care of, help and be good to someone you loved and valued. You may therefore have to conduct yourself habitually in a manner that allows you some respect for your own Being\nTo treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping is, instead, to consider what would be truly good for you. This is not “what you want.” It is also not “what would make you happy.” Every time you give a child something sweet, you make that child happy. That does not mean that you should do nothing for children except feed them candy. “Happy” is by no means synonymous with “good.” You must get children to brush their teeth. They must put on their snowsuits when they go outside in the cold, even though they might object strenuously. You must help a child become a virtuous, responsible, awake being, capable of full reciprocity—able to take care of himself and others, and to thrive while doing so. Why would you think it acceptable to do anything less for yourself?\nRULE 3 MAKE FRIENDS WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT THE BEST FOR YOU # Sometimes, when people have a low opinion of their own worth—or, perhaps, when they refuse responsibility for their lives—they choose a new acquaintance, of precisely the type who proved troublesome in the past. Such people don’t believe that they deserve any better—so they don’t go looking for it. Or, perhaps, they don’t want the trouble of better.\nHere’s something to consider: If you have a friend whose friendship you wouldn’t recommend to your sister, or your father, or your son, why would you have such a friend for yourself? You might say: out of loyalty. Well, loyalty is not identical to stupidity. Loyalty must be negotiated, fairly and honestly. Friendship is a reciprocal arrangement. You are not morally obliged to support someone who is making the world a worse place. Quite the opposite. You should choose people who want things to be better, not worse. It’s a good thing, not a selfish thing, to choose people who are good for you. It’s appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people whose lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.\nIf you surround yourself with people who support your upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner. People who are not aiming up will do the opposite. They will offer a former smoker a cigarette and a former alcoholic a beer. They will become jealous when you succeed, or do something pristine. They will withdraw their presence or support, or actively punish you for it. They will over-ride your accomplishment with a past action, real or imaginary, of their own. Maybe they are trying to test you, to see if your resolve is real, to see if you are genuine. But mostly they are dragging you down because your new improvements cast their faults in an even dimmer light.\nIt is for this reason that every good example is a fateful challenge, and every hero, a judge. Michelangelo’s great perfect marble David cries out to its observer: “You could be more than you are.” When you dare aspire upward, you reveal the inadequacy of the present and the promise of the future. Then you disturb others, in the depths of their souls, where they understand that their cynicism and immobility are unjustifiable. You play Abel to their Cain. You remind them that they ceased caring not because of life’s horrors, which are undeniable, but because they do not want to lift the world up on to their shoulders, where it belongs.\nDon’t think that it is easier to surround yourself with good healthy people than with bad unhealthy people. It’s not. A good, healthy person is an ideal. It requires strength and daring to stand up near such a person. Have some humility. Have some courage. Use your judgment, and protect yourself from too-uncritical compassion and pity.\nRULE 4 COMPARE YOURSELF TO WHO YOU WERE YESTERDAY, NOT TO WHO SOMEONE ELSE IS TODAY # There will always be people better than you—that’s a cliché of nihilism, like the phrase, In a million years, who’s going to know the difference? The proper response to that statement is not, Well, then, everything is meaningless. It’s, Any idiot can choose a frame of time within which nothing matters.\nYour eyes are tools. They are there to help you get what you want. The price you pay for that utility, that specific, focused direction, is blindness to everything else. This doesn’t matter so much when things are going well, and we are getting what we want (although it can be a problem, even then, because getting what we currently want can make blind us to higher callings). But all that ignored world presents a truly terrible problem when we’re in crisis, and nothing whatsoever is turning out the way we want it to. Then, there can be far too much to deal with. Happily, however, that problem contains within it the seeds of its own solution. Since you’ve ignored so much, there is plenty of possibility left where you have not yet looked.\nImagine that you’re unhappy. You’re not getting what you need. Perversely, this may be because of what you want. You are blind, because of what you desire. Perhaps what you really need is right in front of your eyes, but you cannot see it because of what you are currently aiming for. And that brings us to something else: the price that must be paid before you, or anyone, can get what they want (or, better yet, what they need). Think about it this way. You look at the world in your particular, idiosyncratic manner. You use a set of tools to screen most things out and let some things in. You have spent a lot of time building those tools. They’ve become habitual. They’re not mere abstract thoughts. They’re built right into you. They orient you in the world. They’re your deepest and often implicit and unconscious values. They’ve become part of your biological structure. They’re alive. And they don’t want to disappear, or transform, or die. But sometimes their time has come, and new things need to be born. For this reason (although not only for this reason) it is necessary to let things go during the journey uphill. If things are not going well for you—well, that might be because, as the most cynical of aphorisms has it, life sucks, and then you die. Before your crisis impels you to that hideous conclusion, however, you might consider the following: life doesn’t have the problem. You do. At least that realization leaves you with some options. If your life is not going well, perhaps it is your current knowledge that is insufficient, not life itself. Perhaps your value structure needs some serious retooling. Perhaps what you want is blinding you to what else could be. Perhaps you are holding on to your desires, in the present, so tightly that you cannot see anything else—even what you truly need.\nNow you’re on a whole different kind of trajectory. Before, what was right, desirable, and worthy of pursuit was something narrow and concrete. But you became stuck there, tightly jammed and unhappy. So you let go. You make the necessary sacrifice, and allow a whole new world of possibility, hidden from you because of your previous ambition, to reveal itself. And there’s a lot there. What would your life look like, if it were better? What would Life Itself look like? What does “better” even mean? You don’t know. And it doesn’t matter that you don’t know, exactly, right away, because you will start to slowly see what is “better,” once you have truly decided to want it. You will start to perceive what remained hidden from you by your presuppositions and preconceptions—by the previous mechanisms of your vision. You will begin to learn.\nLet’s return to the situation where your aim is being determined by something petty—your aforementioned envy of your boss. Because of that envy, the world you inhabit reveals itself as a place of bitterness, disappointment and spite. Imagine that you come to notice, and contemplate, and reconsider your unhappiness. Further, you determine to accept responsibility for it, and dare to posit that it might be something at least partly under your control. You crack open one eye, for a moment, and look. You ask for something better. You sacrifice your pettiness, repent of your envy, and open your heart. Instead of cursing the darkness, you let in a little light. You decide to aim for a better life—instead of a better office.\nBut you don’t stop there. You realize that it’s a mistake to aim for a better life, if it comes at the cost of worsening someone else’s. So, you get creative. You decide to play a more difficult game. You decide that you want a better life, in a manner that will also make the life of your family better. Or the life of your family, and your friends. Or the life of your family, and your friends, and the strangers who surround them. What about your enemies? Do you want to include them, too? You bloody well don’t know how to manage that. But you’ve read some history. You know how enmity compounds. So, you start to wish even your enemies well, at least in principle, although you are by no means yet a master of such sentiments.\nAnd the direction of your sight changes. You see past the limitations that hemmed you in, unknowingly. New possibilities for your life emerge, and you work toward their realization. Your life indeed improves. And then you start to think, further: “Better? Perhaps that means better for me, and my family, and my friends—even for my enemies. But that’s not all it means. It means better today, in a manner that makes everything better tomorrow, and next week, and next year, and a decade from now, and a hundred years from now. And a thousand years from now. And forever\nPay attention. Focus on your surroundings, physical and psychological. Notice something that bothers you, that concerns you, that will not let you be, which you could fix, that you would fix. You can find such somethings by asking yourself (as if you genuinely want to know) three questions: “What is it that is bothering me?” “Is that something I could fix?” and “Would I actually be willing to fix it?” If you find that the answer is “no,” to any or all of the questions, then look elsewhere. Aim lower. Search until you find something that bothers you, that you could fix, that you would fix, and then fix it. That might be enough for the day.\nRealization is dawning. Instead of playing the tyrant, therefore, you are paying attention. You are telling the truth, instead of manipulating the world. You are negotiating, instead of playing the martyr or the tyrant. You no longer have to be envious, because you no longer know that someone else truly has it better. You no longer have to be frustrated, because you have learned to aim low, and to be patient. You are discovering who you are, and what you want, and what you are willing to do. You are finding that the solutions to your particular problems have to be tailored to you, personally and precisely. You are less concerned with the actions of other people, because you have plenty to do yourself\nRULE 5 DO NOT LET YOUR CHILDREN DO ANYTHING THAT MAKES YOU DISLIKE THEM # We have two general principles of discipline. The first: limit the rules. The second: Use the least force necessary to enforce those rules.\nAbout the first principle, you might ask, “Limit the rules to what, exactly?” Here are some suggestions. Do not bite, kick or hit, except in self-defence. Do not torture and bully other children, so you don’t end up in jail. Eat in a civilized and thankful manner, so that people are happy to have you at their house, and pleased to feed you. Learn to share, so other kids will play with you. Pay attention when spoken to by adults, so they don’t hate you and might therefore deign to teach you something. Go to sleep properly, and peaceably, so that your parents can have a private life and not resent your existence. Take care of your belongings, because you need to learn how and because you’re lucky to have them. Be good company when something fun is happening, so that you’re invited for the fun. Act so that other people are happy you’re around, so that people will want you around. A child who knows these rules will be welcome everywhere.\nAbout the second, equally important principle, your question might be: What is minimum necessary force? This must be established experimentally, starting with the smallest possible intervention. Some children will be turned to stone by a glare. A verbal command will stop another. A thumb-cocked flick of the index finger on a small hand might be necessary for some. Such a strategy is particularly useful in public places such as restaurants. It can be administered suddenly, quietly and effectively, without risking escalation. What’s the alternative? A child who is crying angrily, demanding attention, is not making himself popular. A child who is running from table to table and disrupting everyone’s peace is bringing disgrace (an old word, but a good one) on himself and his parents. Such outcomes are far from optimal, and children will definitely misbehave more in public, because they are experimenting: trying to establish if the same old rules also apply in the new place. They don’t sort that out verbally, not when they are under three.\nDisciplinary principle 1: limit the rules. Principle 2: use minimum necessary force. Here’s a third: parents should come in pairs. Raising young children is demanding and exhausting. Because of this, it’s easy for a parent to make a mistake. Insomnia, hunger, the aftermath of an argument, a hangover, a bad day at work—any of these things singly can make a person unreasonable, while in combination they can produce someone dangerous. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to have someone else around, to observe, and step in, and discuss. This will make it less likely that a whiny provocative child and her fed-up cranky parent will excite each other to the point of no return. Parents should come in pairs so the father of a newborn can watch the new mother so she won’t get worn out and do something desperate after hearing her colicky baby wail from eleven in the evening until five in the morning for thirty nights in a row. I am not saying we should be mean to single mothers, many of whom struggle impossibly and courageously—and a proportion of whom have had to escape, singly, from a brutal relationship—but that doesn’t mean we should pretend that all family forms are equally viable. They’re not. Period.\nHere’s a fourth principle, one that is more particularly psychological: parents should understand their own capacity to be harsh, vengeful, arrogant, resentful, angry and deceitful. Very few people set out, consciously, to do a terrible job as father or mother, but bad parenting happens all the time. This is because people have a great capacity for evil, as well as good—and because they remain willfully blind to that fact. People are aggressive and selfish, as well as kind and thoughtful. For this reason, no adult human being—no hierarchical, predatory ape—can truly tolerate being dominated by an upstart child. Revenge will come. Ten minutes after a pair of all-too-nice-and-patient parents have failed to prevent a public tantrum at the local supermarket, they will pay their toddler back with the cold shoulder when he runs up, excited, to show mom and dad his newest accomplishment. Enough embarrassment, disobedience, and dominance challenge, and even the most hypothetically selfless parent will become resentful. And then the real punishment will begin. Resentment breeds the desire for vengeance. Fewer spontaneous offers of love will be offered, with more rationalizations for their absence. Fewer opportunities for the personal development of the child will be sought out. A subtle turning away will begin. And this is only the beginning of the road to total familial warfare, conducted mostly in the underworld, underneath the false façade of normality and love.\nThis frequently-travelled path is much better avoided. A parent who is seriously aware of his or her limited tolerance and capacity for misbehaviour when provoked can therefore seriously plan a proper disciplinary strategy—particularly if monitored by an equally awake partner—and never let things degenerate to the point where genuine hatred emerges. Beware. There are toxic families everywhere. They make no rules and limit no misbehaviour. The parents lash out randomly and unpredictably. The children live in that chaos and are crushed, if they’re timid, or rebel, counterproductively, if they’re tough. It’s not good. It can get murderous.\nHere’s a fifth and final and most general principle. Parents have a duty to act as proxies for the real world—merciful proxies, caring proxies—but proxies, nonetheless. This obligation supersedes any responsibility to ensure happiness, foster creativity, or boost self-esteem. It is the primary duty of parents to make their children socially desirable. That will provide the child with opportunity, self-regard, and security. It’s more important even than fostering individual identity. That Holy Grail can only be pursued, in any case, after a high degree of social sophistication has been established\nRULE 6 SET YOUR HOUSE IN PERFECT ORDER BEFORE YOU CRITICIZE THE WORLD # Have you cleaned up your life? If the answer is no, here’s something to try: Start to stop doing what you know to be wrong.\nSo, simply stop, when you apprehend, however dimly, that you should stop. Stop acting in that particular, despicable manner. Stop saying those things that make you weak and ashamed. Say only those things that make you strong. Do only those things that you could speak of with honour\nRULE 7 PURSUE WHAT IS MEANINGFUL (NOT WHAT IS EXPEDIENT) # “No tree can grow to Heaven,” adds the ever-terrifying Carl Gustav Jung, psychoanalyst extraordinaire, “unless its roots reach down to Hell.”\nJung observed that the construction of such a moral hierarchy was inevitable—although it could remain poorly arranged and internally self-contradictory. For Jung, whatever was at the top of an individual’s moral hierarchy was, for all intents and purposes, that person’s ultimate value, that person’s god. It was what the person acted out. It was what the person believed most deeply. Something enacted is not a fact, or even a set of facts. Instead, it’s a personality—or, more precisely, a choice between two opposing personalities. It’s Sherlock Holmes or Moriarty. It’s Batman or the Joker. It’s Superman or Lex Luthor, Charles Francis Xavier or Magneto, and Thor or Loki. It’s Abel or Cain—and it’s Christ or Satan. If it’s working for the ennobling of Being, for the establishment of Paradise, then it’s Christ. If it’s working for the destruction of Being, for the generation and propagation of unnecessary suffering and pain, then it’s Satan. That’s the inescapable, archetypal reality.\nRULE 8 TELL THE TRUTH—OR, AT LEAST, DON’T LIE # Someone living a life-lie is attempting to manipulate reality with perception, thought and action, so that only some narrowly desired and pre-defined outcome is allowed to exist. A life lived in this manner is based, consciously or unconsciously, on two premises. The first is that current knowledge is sufficient to define what is good, unquestioningly, far into the future. The second is that reality would be unbearable if left to its own devices. The first presumption is philosophically unjustifiable. What you are currently aiming at might not be worth attaining, just as what you are currently doing might be an error. The second is even worse. It is valid only if reality is intrinsically intolerable and, simultaneously, something that can be successfully manipulated and distorted. Such speaking and thinking requires the arrogance and certainty that the English poet John Milton’s genius identified with Satan, God’s highest angel gone most spectacularly wrong. The faculty of rationality inclines dangerously to pride: all I know is all that needs to be known. Pride falls in love with its own creations, and tries to make them absolute.\nI have seen people define their utopia and then bend their lives into knots trying to make it reality. A left-leaning student adopts a trendy, anti-authority stance and spends the next twenty years working resentfully to topple the windmills of his imagination. An eighteen-year-old decides, arbitrarily, that she wants to retire at fifty-two. She works for three decades to make that happen, failing to notice that she made that decision when she was little more than a child. What did she know about her fifty-two-year-old self, when still a teenager? Even now, many years later, she has only the vaguest, lowest-resolution idea of her post-work Eden. She refuses to notice. What did her life mean, if that initial goal was wrong? She’s afraid of opening Pandora’s box, where all the troubles of the world reside. But hope is in there, too. Instead, she warps her life to fit the fantasies of a sheltered adolescent.\nA naively formulated goal transmutes, with time, into the sinister form of the life-lie. One forty-something client told me his vision, formulated by his younger self: “I see myself retired, sitting on a tropical beach, drinking margaritas in the sunshine.” That’s not a plan. That’s a travel poster. After eight margaritas, you’re fit only to await the hangover. After three weeks of margarita-filled days, if you have any sense, you’re bored stiff and self-disgusted. In a year, or less, you’re pathetic. It’s just not a sustainable approach to later life. This kind of oversimplification and falsification is particularly typical of ideologues. They adopt a single axiom: government is bad, immigration is bad, capitalism is bad, patriarchy is bad. Then they filter and screen their experiences and insist ever more narrowly that everything can be explained by that axiom. They believe, narcissistically, underneath all that bad theory, that the world could be put right, if only they held the controls.\nThere is another fundamental problem, too, with the life-lie, particularly when it is based on avoidance. A sin of commission occurs when you do something you know to be wrong. A sin of omission occurs when you let something bad happen when you could do something to stop it. The former is regarded, classically, as more serious than the latter—than avoidance. I’m not so sure.\nEvery game has rules. Some of the most important rules are implicit. You accept them merely by deciding to play the game. The first of these rules is that the game is important. If it wasn’t important, you wouldn’t be playing it. Playing a game defines it as important. The second is that moves undertaken during the game are valid if they help you win. If you make a move and it isn’t helping you win, then, by definition, it’s a bad move. You need to try something different. You remember the old joke: insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting different results.\nWhat saves is the willingness to learn from what you don’t know. That is faith in the possibility of human transformation. That is faith in the sacrifice of the current self for the self that could be.\nAn aim provides a destination, a point of contrast against the present, and a framework, within which all things can be evaluated. An aim defines progress and makes such progress exciting. An aim reduces anxiety, because if you have no aim everything can mean anything or nothing, and neither of those two options makes for a tranquil spirit. Thus, we have to think, and plan, and limit, and posit, in order to live at all.\nRULE 9 ASSUME THAT THE PERSON YOU ARE LISTENING TO MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING YOU DON’T # RULE 10 BE PRECISE IN YOUR SPEECH # Why refuse to specify, when specifying the problem would enable its solution? Because to specify the problem is to admit that it exists. Because to specify the problem is to allow yourself to know what you want, say, from friend or lover—and then you will know, precisely and cleanly, when you don’t get it, and that will hurt, sharply and specifically. But you will learn something from that, and use what you learn in the future—and the alternative to that single sharp pain is the dull ache of continued hopelessness and vague failure and the sense that time, precious time, is slipping by.\nWhy refuse to specify? Because while you are failing to define success (and thereby rendering it impossible) you are also refusing to define failure, to yourself, so that if and when you fail you won’t notice, and it won’t hurt. But that won’t work! You cannot be fooled so easily—unless you have gone very far down the road! You will instead carry with you a continual sense of disappointment in your own Being and the self-contempt that comes along with that and the increasing hatred for the world that all of that generates (or degenerates).\nIf you shirk the responsibility of confronting the unexpected, even when it appears in manageable doses, reality itself will become unsustainably disorganized and chaotic. Then it will grow bigger and swallow all order, all sense, and all predictability. Ignored reality transforms itself (reverts back) into the great Goddess of Chaos, the great reptilian Monster of the Unknown—the great predatory beast against which mankind has struggled since the dawn of time. If the gap between pretence and reality goes unmentioned, it will widen, you will fall into it, and the consequences will not be good. Ignored reality manifests itself in an abyss of confusion and suffering.\nSay what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise?\nConfront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles. Specify your destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Narrow, and gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly.\nRULE 11 DO NOT BOTHER CHILDREN WHEN THEY ARE SKATEBOARDING # One day, when I was a kid, I was out playing softball with some friends. The teams were a mixture of boys and girls. We were all old enough so that the boys and girls were starting to be interested in one another in an unfamiliar way. Status was becoming more relevant and important. My friend Jake and I were about to come to blows, pushing each other around near the pitching mound, when my mom walked by. She was a fair distance away, about thirty yards, but I could immediately see by the change in her body language that she knew what was going on. Of course, the other kids saw her as well. She walked right by. I knew that hurt her. Part of her was worried that I would come home with a bloody nose and a black eye. It would have been easy enough for her just to yell, “Hey, you kids, quit that!” or even to come over and interfere. But she didn’t. A few years later, when I was having teenage trouble with my dad, my mom said, “If it was too good at home, you’d never leave.”\nMy mom is a tender-hearted person. She’s empathetic, and cooperative, and agreeable. Sometimes she lets people push her around. When she went back to work after being at home with her young kids, she found it challenging to stand up to the men. Sometimes that made her resentful—something she also feels, sometimes, in relationship to my father, who is strongly inclined to do what he wants, when he wants to. Despite all that, she’s no Oedipal mother. She fostered the independence of her children, even though doing so was often hard on her. She did the right thing, even though it caused her emotional distress.\nRULE 12 PET A CAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ONE ON THE STREET # "},{"id":7,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f_ck/","title":"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck","section":"Book Summaries","content":" The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck - by Mark Manson # Date Read: 2023-05-05 # Notes # In short this book, is about choosing the right values and focusing on the process and not the outcome, about choosing pain over pleasure.\nThe desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience.

If we’re unwilling to fail, then we’re unwilling to succeed Shitty values, involve tangible external goals outside of our control. The pursuit of these goals causes great anxiety. And even if we manage to achieve them, they leave us feeling empty and lifeless, because once they’re achieved there are no more problems to solve. Then say hello to your midlife crisis. Better values are process-oriented. Having an existential crisis is good because everything you previously thought to be true and normal and good has turned out to be the opposite. It’s important to feel the pain. Because if you just chase after highs to cover up the pain, then you’ll never generate the requisite motivation to actually change. Action → Inspiration → Motivation Good Value - Commitment - to value something, we must reject what is not that something\nPeople in a healthy relationship with strong boundaries will take responsibility for their own values and problems and not take responsibility for their partner’s values and problems People can’t solve your problems for you. And they shouldn’t try, because that won’t make you happy. You can’t solve other people’s problems for them either, because that likewise won’t make them happy For a relationship to be healthy, both people must be willing and able to both say no and hear no. Without that negation, without that occasional rejection, boundaries break down and one person’s problems and values come to dominate the other’s Trust is the most important ingredient in any relationship, for the simple reason that without trust, the relationship doesn’t actually mean anything Commitment gives you freedom because you’re no longer distracted by the unimportant and frivolous. Commitment gives you freedom because it hones your attention and focus, directing them toward what is most efficient at making you healthy and happy. Commitment makes decision-making easier and removes any fear of missing out; knowing that what you already have is good enough, why would you ever stress about chasing more, more, more again? Commitment allows you to focus intently on a few highly important goals and achieve a greater degree of success than you otherwise would.

Keeping secrets and leaving things foggy—to maintain your feeling of independence. Avoiding physical closeness Unhelpful thought patterns\nMistaking Self-Reliance for Independence Seeing the Worm Instead of the Apple Coaching (Avoidant)\nLearn to identify deactivating strategies. Don’t act on your impulse. When you’re excited about someone but then suddenly have a gut feeling that s/he is not right for you, stop and think. Is this actually a deactivating strategy? Are all those small imperfections you’re starting to notice really your attachment system’s way of making you step back? Remind yourself that this picture is skewed and that you need intimacy despite your discomfort with it. If you thought s/he was great to begin with, you have a lot to lose by pushing him or her away. De-emphasize self-reliance and focus on mutual support. When your partner feels s/he has a secure base to fall back on (and doesn’t feel the need to work hard to get close), and when you don’t feel the need to distance yourself, you’ll both be better able to look outward and do your own thing. You’ll become more independent and your partner will be less needy. Find a secure partner. As you will see in chapter 7, people with secure attachment styles tend to make their anxious and avoidant partners more secure as well. Someone with an anxious attachment style, however, will exacerbate your avoidance—often in a perpetual vicious cycle. Given a chance, we recommend you choose the secure route. You’ll experience less defensiveness, less fighting, and less anguish. Be aware of your tendency to misinterpret behaviors. Negative views of your partner’s behaviors and intentions infuse bad vibes into the relationship. Change this pattern! Recognize this tendency, notice when it happens, and look for a more plausible perspective. Remind yourself that this is your partner, you chose to be together, and that maybe you’re better off trusting that they do have your best interests at heart. Make a relationship gratitude list. Remind yourself on a daily basis that you tend to think negatively of your partner or date. It is simply part of your makeup if you have an avoidant attachment style. Your objective should be to notice the positive in your partner’s actions. This may not be an easy task, but with practice and perseverance, you’ll gradually get the hang of it. Take time every evening to think back on the events of the day. List at least one way your partner contributed, even in a minor way, to your well-being, and why you’re grateful they’re in your life. Nix the phantom ex. When you find yourself idealizing that one special ex-partner, stop and acknowledge that he or she is not (and never was) a viable option. By remembering how critical you were of that relationship—and how leery you were of committing—you can stop using him or her as a deactivating strategy and focus on someone new. Forget about “the one.” We don’t dispute the presence of soul mates in our world. On the contrary, we wholeheartedly believe in the soul mate experience. But it is our belief that you have to be an active party in the process. Don’t wait until “the one” who fits your checklist shows up and then expect everything to fall into place. Make them into your soul mate by choosing them out of the crowd, allowing them to get close (using the strategies we offer in this chapter) and making them a special part of you. Adopt the distraction strategy. As an avoidant, it’s easier to get close to your partner if there’s a distraction (remember the experiment with a distraction task). Focusing on other things—taking a hike, going sailing, or preparing a meal together—will allow you to let your guard down Secures\nGreat conflict busters Mentally flexible Effective communicators Not game players Comfortable with closeness, unconcerned about boundaries Quick to forgive Inclined to view sex and emotional intimacy as one Treat their partners like royalty Secure in their power to improve the relationship Responsible for their partners’ well-being Providing a secure base\nBe available Don\u0026rsquo;t interfere Encourage The anxious-avoidant trap The roller-coaster effect. In the relationship you never sail along on an even keel. Instead, every once in a while, when the avoidant partner makes him/herself available to the anxious partner, the latter’s attachment system is temporarily quieted and you achieve extreme closeness—leading to the feeling of a “high.” This closeness, however, is perceived as a threat by the avoidant partner and is quickly followed by withdrawal on his or her part—only to create renewed dissatisfaction for the anxious partner. Life in the inner circle as the enemy. If you are anxious, you find that you’re getting treated worse instead of better once you become the person closest to the avoidant partner.\nEscaping the trap\nwhat were the patterns? what triggered the activation/deactivation? What were the feelings identify insecure model identify what is lost identify a secure role model and secure principles to adopt Effective communication\nWear your heart on your sleeve Focus on your needs. Be specific Don’t blame Be assertive and nonapologetic Judging the response\nDoes s/he try to get to the bottom of your concerns?\nDoes s/he respond to the issue at hand or does s/he try to dodge you?\nDoes s/he take your concerns seriously or does s/he try to belittle you or make you feel foolish for raising them?\nDoes s/he try to find ways to make you feel better or is s/he only busy acting defensive?\nIs s/he replying to your concerns only factually (as in a court of law) or is s/he also in tune with your emotional well-being?\nIf you are anxious—turn to effective communication when you feel you are starting to resort to protest behavior. When something your partner has said or done (or refrained from saying or doing) has activated your attachment system to the point where you feel you’re on the verge of acting out—by not answering his or her calls, threatening to leave, or engaging in any other form of protest behavior—stop yourself. Then figure out what your real needs are and use effective communication instead. But only after you’ve thoroughly calmed down (which for someone anxious can sometimes take a day or two).\nIf you are avoidant—the surefire sign that you need to use effective communication is when you feel an irrepressible need to bolt. Use effective communication to explain to your partner that you need some space and that you’d like to find a way of doing so that is acceptable to him or her. Suggest a few alternatives, making sure that the other person’s needs are taken care of. By doing so, you’re more likely to get the breathing space you need.\nFive Secure Principles for Resolving Conflict\nShow basic concern for the other person’s well-being.

Practice passage below\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a disagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank grass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass was so thick that it hid them from sight.\nHowever, by carefully picking their way, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the country seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the underbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older than any they had ever seen.\n“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking around him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”\n“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.\n“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live here all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how rich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast could wish a pleasanter home.”\n“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.\n“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see any of them about.”\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther. Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the Scarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\nConversation Resume # Daily life:\nWhat did you do over the weekend?

It is the lazy way of your brain\u0026rsquo;s process modify expectations and realign the source of difficulty: extraordinary results demand extraordinary efforts. Stop searching for shortcuts identify and visualize the change target apply numbers to the goal: e.g. sales, profits, number of customers identify the daily action target identify threats to the daily target: what you need to stop doing identify the correct battlefields: eating healthy is fought at the grocery store, not at the kitchen. playing less games is keeping the game console in the attic. attack bad habits with inconvenience and/or pain act until echo: take disciplined action until a feedback loop kicks in. work until you strike your first echo. only then, decide your next step. Belief 2: The Special Scam: \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not good at that\u0026rdquo;. The belief that talent alone is enough. The belief that talent is immovable, fixed, cannot be improved.\nFixed (99%) vs Growth (1%)\nPraise improvement, habits, growth and efforts.\nTiny incremental improvement on yourself mastery over performance.

Money-chasers jump from business idea to idea, job to job, opportunity to opportunity, as if money can be stalked, the next FBA product to be found, the next forex strategy, \u0026hellip;\nMoney (99%) vs Value (1%)\nIn a transaction, money is just a transaction mediator where agreed perceived value is stored. (Actual value can be very different from the perceived value transacted) Money can only be attracted by offering perceived value. Money doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a brain but its possessors do. It responds to a value stimulus (with biases and prejudices). Value-vouchers - a store of perceived value produced, communicated and delivered to the world.

Using time to earn money has a ceiling, no matter how high it is. Belief 8: The Compound-interest Scam.\nWealth (99%) vs Income (1%)\nWhy is it not effective?\nTime - by the time you find out its not effective, its too late. You give up abundance now for possible wealth later. Reality - doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account risk, yield-peddling conmen, fear. Inflation - trust is not in the picture. Can the government be a good steward of taxpayers money? Can fiscal policy makers keep inflation from exploding? Can you trust a growing economy for five decades? Capital-Principle: use the market for income (interest) or capital appreciation (speculation), but don\u0026rsquo;t hope to get rich here. Biases\nChange adversity: do not prefer the status quo. Opportunity is served on the silver platter of change. Changes in search behaviour, in technology, etc. Being right: your brain prefers to be right, rather than to examine the evidence closely. Don\u0026rsquo;t fall for it. Don\u0026rsquo;t be trapped by confirmation bias.\nAntithetical apathy: do not fear success. being rich does not mean being evil. beware of mental traps/contradictions you have ingrained. Semmelwashing: being unconventional will draw you a lot of criticism from people who want to be conventional.\nPodium popping: Someone else\u0026rsquo;s pen can\u0026rsquo;t write your story. It is the ineffective application of various success strategies cherry-picked from individuals who have a broadcast podium. New successes blaze new roads; they don\u0026rsquo;t trail old ones.\nSurvival spotlighting: You see the success story trumpeted by the media. But remember to think, there could be many more who tried and followed but could/did not get to tell their story.\nMomentum paralysis: being unable to depart from current course of action. Loss aversion + status quo bias.\nBullshit 1: excuses, narrative bias\nAntidote 1: socratic questioning. Why do I think this way? Why is that so? Why?\nBullshit 2: Frankenphrases - parroting ideas without knowing what they mean\nAntidote 2: does someone have what you want? and how much does it cost?\nBullshit 3: Gurus bearing gifts, shortcuts.\nAntidote 3: Gurus should practice what they preach, have skin in the game.\nEntrepreneurship lives or dies in your head. Be an entrepreneur. Do (take actions that this identity would do). Have (only after a long process, can you emerge as an entrepreneur)\nMeaning-Purpose are the core reasons to go through hardship, criticism and failure. Not from willpower or motivation. (Refer to motivation cycle diagram in the book) M-P is your camel through the desert-of-no-feedback when you start out. Bad advice: \u0026ldquo;do what you love\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;follow your passion\u0026rdquo;. Instead, \u0026ldquo;do what you hate\u0026rdquo; - a barometer for how much pain and anxiety you will endure. \u0026ldquo;do what contributes\u0026rdquo; the moment when people love what you do, it feeds back into the motivation cycle\u0026rsquo;s feedback loop.\nChange your Life:\nIdentity Meaning-Purpose Passion via the feedback loop Possible purposes: Adding value to others, Freedom, Family, Fitness Choose to control, choose to change your life. Not thinking that external events are out of your control. Fastlane Entrepreneurship\nProductocracy - product sells itself without need for advertising\nCENTS (Control, Entry, Need, Time, Scale)\nControl - FBA business where arbitrary decisions can destroy your business? You have no control in an FBA business. Selling Herbalife, Avon products? No Control. You must control your brand, mailing list, platform.\nEntry - the easier the opportunity the worse it is. The harder something is to solve, the greater the opportunity. Things which have been easified become highly visible, and highly competitive. e.g. blogging, forums, self-publishing, affliate marketing, FBA. By this very definition, there is no list, no blueprint. The person who knows, will not share it with you. Only executional excellence can overcome easy entry.\nNeed - Only in a Utopian world are there no problems, needs, or wants. People who don\u0026rsquo;t see opportunity can\u0026rsquo;t see it because they don\u0026rsquo;t want to see what they need to see: unknown variables, new skills, hard work, trial and error, risk, and failure.\nMoney moves only when there is a value skew. Underneath this competition is an array of value attributes, which characterizes all market offers. Examples - Price, Professionalism, Price Ambiguity, Compelling Story, Ease of Ordering, Label Design, Website Design, Affliations, Cleanliness, Customer Service, Guarantee, Clean Photos, Refund Policy, Public Reviews, Included/Excluded Ingredients, Endorsements, \u0026hellip;, (think of any and everything because value attributes affect people differently)\nTo engineer a value skew, (1) examine your product and identify every value skew, (2) examine all secondary attributes, the product\u0026rsquo;s marketing and delivery.\n6 Value skew myths\nthe market myth - business owner who does not see relative value as a success metric, \u0026ldquo;doing what he loves\u0026rdquo;. the isolation myth - when business is isolated by one value attribute, price, it becomes commodified. the blockbuster myth - thinking there will not be competition by being the first to market. the crowded-room myth - thinking that idea is no good because someone is already doing it. the empty-room myth - thinking that idea is no good because there is no market for it. (4) + (5) = entrepreneurial circle jerk, because all ideas fall into one of the two categories. the use myth - no where does it state that you have to be an avid user of the product you sell Finding FE ideas - two sources of ideas - innovation (doing something never done before), or improvement (tread an existing path but do it better by skewing value attributes)\nLanguage - people saying \u0026ldquo;I hate \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;This sucks \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;, \u0026hellip; Inconvenience Simplification/Easification Wants - luxury opportunities where demand is influenced by marketing Service Gaps Geographical arbitrage Crowdfeeding entry violations - in a gold rush, sell shovels. Value arbitrage, 9) repurposing - raising something of low value by fixing it up Marketing arbitrage - using an underleveraged asset and using it more effectively Overcapitalism - business models that serve the shareholders more than the customer, hence creating opportunity Improvement and Removement - improve by changing a part or removing one Domain experience Time - your value must exist in space-time separate from you. your enterprise must exist in space-time without you. Passive income is the outcome of all the effort placed into systems in your enterprise\u0026rsquo;s early years and processes. Focus on this legacy value system. Legacy Value Systems (LVS)\nMoney systems - using money to make money. works only if you already have millions. Digital Product Systems - ebooks, pdfs, youtube, blogs, podcasts, website templates, skins, scripts. SaaS, internet platforms, mobile apps, enterprise software, video games. Product Systems - food products, clothing, cosmetics, books, inventions, gadgets Rental systems - rental real estate, rental services(party, heavy equipments), parking garages, licensing. Human Resource systems - a system that requires people for operation, e.g. restaurants, consulting, Legacy Structures - perpetual systems that support your LVS. e.g. podcasts, interviews, forum posts. Legacy\u0026rsquo;s price is your time - lots of it.\nScale - 4 components\nLVS Replication Mass or magnitude Profitable impact within 1 year To get started, you have to impact one customer profitably. The market size you serve should be large enough, to get a better Expected Value (EV), in spite of higher chance of failure. Do you own a business that pays bills for a month or for a lifetime? In either business you\u0026rsquo;re going to have to work very hard, so make sure it is worth it. EV is the outcome of many occurences. There is no try. Taking a shot is like playing lottery. Three basic scaling strategies:\nCustomer Strategy - selling direct Unit Strategy - chains, franchising, licensing Channel Strategy - selling wholesale to decision makers of the channel Kinetic Execution - \u0026ldquo;just wing it\u0026rdquo; - You don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s needed until you need it.\nThe Marketmind The 3 A\u0026rsquo;s The 7P\u0026rsquo;s of Process The Marketmind - the market cannot be forecast, predicted or tamed. Engage it. Act, Assess, Adjust - one problem at a time. Listen to the reactions, either no reaction or uncensored feedback/complaint. Assess these feedbacks. Plan, Path, Proof (Soft), Prototype, Proof (Hard), Productocracy, Propogate. Plan, Path - does your idea fulfil CENTS commandments? Proof (Soft) - verify your idea with the Marketmind before spending more. Verify by\nLanguage patterns - \u0026ldquo;I hate \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;. Beware: just because people hate something doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean people will pay for the solution. Channel Research - e.g. looking up sales, reviews for a similar product on Amazon. Search Volume - look into CPC, Keyword Planning tools to see how many people search for such a product. Ask/Interview the market - find a congregation of your marketmind and expose them to your idea. e.g. subreddits or targeted Facebook ads/groups Market Simulation - present your market as if it already exists. One method is the Landing Page. A one-page sell sheet solely for the purpose of collecting email addresses or pre-orders. Another way is to have an order page that presents buyer with \u0026ldquo;Sold Out\u0026rdquo;. Beware: interest and commitment are not the same. Captured email addresses are circumstantial soft proof; cash is verdict and hard proof. Mock prototyping is another method. Create a nonfunctional version of your idea and ask the market using a method above. Or you could get influencers to market your product and find out their audience reaction to it. Process Path - draft out your tasks and subtasks\nPrototyping - after outlining the process path and confirming soft proof, you need a functional prototype. It must be valuable and economically demandable. Expect a lot of just-in-time learning. Build at the end, from the customer experience. Beware: the desert of desertion, as you might not get feedback while you work on your prototype.\nProof (Hard), Productocracy, Propogate - Occur within the customer lifecycle\nAwareness: Exposing your product to target. e.g. through ads Evaluation: Provide your customer with enough info to make a decision. e.g. website, search, white paper Onboarding: Converting strangers into prospects by securing them into your marketing ecosystem. e.g. customer provides email address or signs up for free trial. Purchase: Converting prospect to customer. e.g. customer converts from free trial to paid premium or buys your product after being emailed free content Use: Manage and monitor how your customer uses your product. e.g. renews or reorders; asks for a variation you do not have Engagement: Relationship building with customer for retention and/or repurchase. e.g. sending a periodic email about trends or topics within your industry Discipleship: Creating loyal customers who become evangelists for your company, hence fulfilling the productocracy. e.g. your customer shares and recommends your product in social media. Pushing Proof (Hard) - a long process. Awareness, Evaluation, Onboarding. Listen to the Marketmind Use crowdfunding platforms only if you already have a solid offer. If the market is silent, (1) check your channel and targeting options, (2) check your reach.. you need a large enough sample size, at least 10,000 impressions and/or 1,000 clicks, (3) check you message, copy, offer, call to action, UI.\nProductocracy - confirm if actual value is delivered (worthy of discipleship) over perceived value (worthy of nothing). If not, keep listening and skewing value.\nPropagation - when productocracy is confirmed and disciples start evangelizing. Add fuel to the fire by reach expansion, channel expansion, network expansion. Reach expansion - expand product awareness, e.g. paid marketing, social media initiatives, provide valuable content FOC as contributor or guest articles on Medium, Quora, etc. Channel expansion - adding locations where the product is sold. Network expansion - networking, partnering with others, business development, affiliate marketing, win-win joint ventures. Find partners who share a similar purpose synergize your effort.\nBest Practices\nExpect difficulty and deviation from your original plan. Listen to the market. Work on only one idea Your life will not be balanced initially. Expect 10-12hr days, 30 days in a row. Find a supportive environment Gatekeepers are dying; don\u0026rsquo;t ask for permission. Check with the marketmind directly. Build a Brand likened to a personality. Be consistent with the brand you build Selling, Marketing, Communication, Copywriting, Negotiation. Learn them all. Tell a Story. Humanize your corporation, add informal/playful faces to \u0026ldquo;About Us\u0026rdquo;. Engage on social media. Appeal to self-interest, meaning and purpose, sell benefits. Prioritize social proof. If you receive an email, ask them to leave a review, permission to use it Shelve your biases and use what works. Being rich is more important than being right. Forget about SEO. With great content comes great SEO. Avoid Fads or Trends, unless you just want the experience No politics in business. You will lose half your customers. You will be criticized 4 Disciplines\nComparative Immunity - Comparison is future oriented and focused on what is missing, creating anxiety. Gratitude is present oriented and focused on what you have, creating peace. Which parts of your life are susceptible to comparison rituals?\nPurposed Saving - towards goals of UNSCRIPTED, passive income, early retirement,\u0026hellip;\nMeasured Elevation - if you have to do a lot of mental calculation to determine if you can afford something, it means you actually can\u0026rsquo;t afford it. Reward yourself and be reasonable\nConsequential thought - impulsive actions (events) have the potential to ruin your life, undoing many years of work. Negative people or influences, no matter their label (family, coworker,\u0026hellip;) should be cut off. Think before acting, \u0026hellip;, is the worst case consequence acceptable?\nThe money system\n3 pots\n\u0026ldquo;fuck you\u0026rdquo; pot - cash to get whatever you desire. whatever you can put at risk to lose. home pot - own a home free and clear paycheck pot - passive income system 7 Paycheck pot rules\nRent rule - capital is allocated to collect rent, not for growth or appreciation Snap rule - Capital should be placed in a liquid instrument Apocalypse rule - capital should be managed in institutions that are \u0026ldquo;too big to fail\u0026rdquo;. When things go wrong, you can be sure that everything is going to meltdown \u0026ldquo;3 years in 3 months\u0026rdquo; - if you earned 3 years of dividends in 3 months, consider selling \u0026ldquo;Admiral Ackbar\u0026rdquo; rule - if it sounds too good to be true, it\u0026rsquo;s a trap. Dividend traps: 20% dividend yield? something is going to blow up soon. If you choose to invest, its a speculative one, i.e. belongs to the \u0026ldquo;fuck you\u0026rdquo; pot. Always go for low fee funds \u0026ldquo;Ostrich\u0026rdquo; rule - if the business is out of touch with current cultural or economic climate, choose another business. Also applies if it is a fad or trend company. e.g. Radioshack, Nokia, Peloton, Chesapeake Energy. Based on this 7 rules, this author placed 100% of paycheck pot assets into income producing assets.\n"},{"id":14,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/we-learn-nothing/","title":"We Learn Nothing","section":"Book Summaries","content":" We Learn Nothing - by Tim Kreider # Date Read: 2019-11-20 # Notes # What if you had a brush with death but it did not change your life?\nDifference between a bold romantic gesture and stalking?

There is now far more money flowing into the stock markets than there is intelligence to guide it. There are many more mutual funds than there are financially acute, historically aware men and women to manage them. I am not given to prediction; one\u0026rsquo;s foresight is forgotten, only one\u0026rsquo;s errors are well remembered. But there is here a basic and recurrent process. It comes with rising prices, whether of stocks, real estate, works of art or anything else. This increase attracts attention and buyers, which produces the further effect of even higher prices. Expectations are thus justified by the very action that sends prices up. The process continues; optimism with its market effect is the order of the day. Prices go up even more. Then, for reasons that will endlessly be debated, comes the end. The descent is always more sudden than the increase; a balloon that has been punctured does not deflate in an orderly way.\nThere would also be, we may be certain, the traditional reassuring words from Washington. Always when markets are in trouble, the phrases are the same: \u0026ldquo;The economic situation is fundamentally sound\u0026rdquo; or simply \u0026ldquo;The fundamentals are good\u0026rdquo;. All who hear these words should know that something is wrong.\nThat much of what was repeated about the market - then as now - bore no relation to reality is important, but not remarkable. Between human beings there is a type of intercourse which proceeds not from knowledge, or even from lack of knowledge, but from failure to know what isn\u0026rsquo;t known. This was true of much of the discourse on the market. At luncheon in downtown Scranton, the knowledgeable physician spoke of the impending split-up in the stock of Western Utility Investors and the effect on prices. Neither the doctor nor his listeners knew why there should be a split up, why it should increase values, or even why Western Utility Investors should have any value. But neither the doctor nor his audience knew that he did not know. Wisdom, itself, is often an abstraction associated not with fact or reality but with the man who asserts it and the manner of its assertion.\nThe no-business meeting # Yet to suppose that President Hoover was engaged only in organizing further reassurance is to do him a serious injustice. He was also conducting one of the oldest, most important—and, unhappily, one of the least understood—rites in American life. This is the rite of the meeting which is called not to do business but to do no business. It is a rite which is still much practiced in our time. It is worth examining for a moment.\nMen meet together for many reasons in the course of business. They need to instruct or persuade each other. They must agree on a course of action. They find thinking in public more productive or less painful than thinking in private. But there are at least as many reasons for meetings to transact no business. Meetings are held because men seek companionship or, at a minimum, wish to escape the tedium of solitary duties. They yearn for the prestige which accrues to the man who presides over meetings, and this leads them to convoke assemblages over which they can preside. Finally, there is the meeting which is called not because there is business to be done, but because it is necessary to create the impression that business is being done. Such meetings are more than a substitute for action. They are widely regarded as action.\nThe fact that no business is transacted at a no-business meeting is normally not a serious cause of embarrassment to those attending. Numerous formulas have been devised to prevent discomfort. Thus scholars, who are great devotees of the no-business meeting, rely heavily on the exchange-of-ideas justification. To them the exchange of ideas is an absolute good. Any meeting at which ideas are exchanged is, therefore, useful. This justification is nearly ironclad. It is very hard to have a meeting of which it can be said that no ideas were exchanged.\nSalesmen and sales executives, who also are important practitioners of the no-business gathering, commonly have a different justification and one that has strong spiritual overtones. Out of the warmth of comradeship, the interplay of personality, the stimulation of alcohol, and the inspiration of oratory comes an impulsive rededication to the daily task. The meeting pays for itself in a fuller and better life and the sale of more goods in future weeks and months.\nThe no-business meetings of the great business executives depend for their illusion of importance on something quite different. Not the exchange of ideas or the spiritual rewards of comradeship, but a solemn sense of assembled power gives significance to this assemblage. Even though nothing of importance is said or done, men of importance cannot meet without the occasion seeming important. Even the commonplace observation of the head of a large corporation is still the statement of the head of a large corporation. What it lacks in content it gains in power from the assets back of it.\nThe no-business meeting was an almost perfect instrument for the situation in which President Hoover found himself in the autumn of 1929. The modest tax cut apart, the President was clearly averse to any large-scale government action to counter the developing depression. Nor was it very certain, at the time, what could be done. Yet by 1929 popular faith in laissez faire had been greatly weakened. No responsible political leader could safely proclaim a policy of keeping hands off. The no-business meetings at the White House were a practical expression of laissez faire. No positive action resulted. At the same time they gave a sense of truly impressive action. The conventions governing the no-business session insured that there would be no embarrassment arising from the absence of business. Those who attended accepted as a measure of the importance of the meetings the importance of the people attending. The newspapers also cooperated in emphasizing the importance of the sessions. Had they done otherwise they would, of course, have undermined the value of the sessions as news.\nIn recent times the no-business meeting at the White House—attended by governors, industrialists, representatives of business, labor, and agriculture—has become an established institution of government. Some device for simulating action, when action is impossible, is indispensable in a sound and functioning democracy. Mr. Hoover in 1929 was a pioneer in this field of public administration.\nAs the depression deepened, it was said that Mr. Hoover\u0026rsquo;s meetings had been a failure. This, obviously, reflects a very narrow view.\nHere, at least equally with communism, lies the threat to capitalism. It is what causes men who know that things are going quite wrong to say that things are fundamentally sound.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/a-guide-to-the-good-life/","title":"A Guide to the Good Life","section":"Book Summaries","content":" A Guide to the Good Life - by William B.

And like the sword, the danger will be silent, inexorable, and discontinuous. It will fall abruptly after long periods of quiet, perhaps at the very moment one has gotten used to it and forgotten about its existence. Black Swans will be out there to get you as you now have much more to lose, a cost of success (and growth), perhaps an unavoidable penalty of excessive success. At the end, what matters is the strength of the string - not the wealth and power of the dining party. But, luckily, this is an identifiable, measurable, and tractable vulnerability, for those who want to listen. The entire point of the Triad is that in many situations we can measure the strength of the string.\nHow do you innovate? First, you try to get in trouble. I mean serious, but not terminal, trouble. I hold - it is beyond speculation, rather a conviction - that innovation and sophistication spark from initial situations of necessity (from the unintended side effects of, say, an initial invention or attempt at invention). Naturally, there are classical thoughts on the subject, with a Latin saying that sophistication is born out of hunger. The idea pervades classical literature: in Ovid, difficulty is what wakes up the genius, which translate in Brooklyn English into \u0026ldquo;When life gives you a lemon \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The excess energy released from overreaction to setbacks is what innovates!\nThere is another dimension to the need to focus on actions and avoid words: the health-eroding dependence on external recognition. People are cruel and unfair in the way they confer recognition, so it is best to stay out of that game. Stay robust to how others treat you. Nero at some stage befriended a scientist of legendary status, a giant for whom he had immense respect. Although the fellow was about as prominent as one could get in his field (in the eyes of others), he spent his time focused on the status he had that week in the scientific community. He would become enraged at authors who did not cite him or at some committee granting a medal he had never received to someone he judged inferior, that imposter! Nero learned that no matter how satisfied they could be with their work, these hotshots-who-depended-on-words were deprived of Tony\u0026rsquo;s serenity; they remained fragile to the emotional toll from the compliments they did not get, the ones others got, and from what someone of lower intellect stole from them. So Nero promised himself to escape all of this with his small ritual - just in case he should fall prone to the hos-shot\u0026rsquo;s temptation. Nero\u0026rsquo;s spoils from what he called the \u0026ldquo;Fat Tony bet\u0026rdquo;, after deducting the cost of a new car (a Mini) and a new $60 Swatch watch, amounted to a dizzyingly large amount sitting in a portfolio, the summary of which was mailed to him monthly from (of all places) a New Jersey address, with three other statements from overseas countries. Again, it is not the amount but the tangibility of his action that counted - quantities could have been a tenth, even a hundredth as much and the effect would remain the same. So he would cure himself of the game of recognition by opening the envelope containing the statement and then going on with his day, oblivious to the presence of those cruel and unfair users of words.\n\u0026hellip; an absence of fragility to decisions made by fate, is robustness.\n\u0026hellip; if something is fragile, its risk of breaking makes anything you do to improve it or make it \u0026ldquo;efficient\u0026rdquo; inconsequential unless you first reduce that risk of breaking.\nFor antifragility is the combination aggressiveness plus paranoia - clip your downside, protect yourself from extreme harm, and let the upside, the positive Black Swans, take care of itself. We saw Seneca\u0026rsquo;s asymmetry: more upside than downside can come simply from the reduction of extreme downside (emotional harm) rather than improving things in the middle.\nOption = asymmetry + rationality # Be prepared to take advantage, keep the good and ditch the bad. \u0026ldquo;exercise the option\u0026rdquo;, recognise that what you have now is better than before.\nBusiness school methods of computing risks do not take into account the possibility of rare events.\nRandomness of life is not the well-tractable one of casinos (there are rare events, there are unlimited upsides.)\nOptionality - with minimal downside, you do not need knowledge and asymmetry will help you.\ne.g. Rent controlled apartment - if rents go up, you are protected. If you want to leave you can. If rents go down, you can get a cheaper place or get a cheap mortgage. e.g. Author, artists - better to have a small number of fanatics than a large number of people appreciate. The number of persons who dislike don\u0026rsquo;t count - there is no opposite of buying your book. e.g. In work, it is better to have a large number of people disliking you and your message and have a low extremely loyal supporters. e.g. Luxury goods - average stays the same with larger dispersion. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about the average e.g. Real Estate - investors have the option at the expense of banks e.g. technology - through trial and error e.g. Negative option - banks have lost everything they made through blowups "},{"id":33,"href":"/docs/book-summaries/mans-search-for-meaning/","title":"Man's Search for Meaning","section":"Book Summaries","content":" Man\u0026rsquo;s Search for Meaning - by Viktor E.

You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.\nThere is a scene in Arthur Miller\u0026rsquo;s play Incident at Vichy in which an upper middle class professional man appears before the Nazi authority that has occupied his town and shows his credentials: his university degrees, his letters of reference from prominent citizens, and so on. The Nazi asks him, \u0026ldquo;Is that everything you have?\u0026rdquo; The man nods. The Nazi throws it all in the wastebasket and tells him: \u0026ldquo;Good, now you have nothing\u0026rdquo;.\nWe all said to each other in camp that there could be no earthly happiness which could compensate for all we had suffered. We were not hoping for happiness - it was not that which gave us courage and gave meaning to our suffering, our sacrifices and our dying. And yet we were not prepared for unhappiness. (Suffering, happiness, lack of happiness, unhappiness are different emotions, state of being. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that removing suffering can bring about happiness.)\nMental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish. (Also, mental health affects physical health)\nSometimes, the frustrated will to meaning is vicariously compensated for by a will to power, including the most primitive form of the will to power, the will to money. In other cases, the place of frustrated will to meaning is taken by the will to pleasure. That is why existential frustration often eventuates in sexual compensation. We can observe in such cases that the sexual libido becomes rampant in the existential vacuum.\nMan should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy sees in responsibleness the very essence of human existence.\nTrue meaning of life is to be discovered in the world rather than within man. We can discover the meaning of life in three different ways: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering (when facing a fate that cannot be changed, to transform personal tragedy into triumph).\n\u0026ldquo;Has all this suffering, this dying around us, a meaning? For, if not, then ultimately there is no meaning to survival; for a life whose meaning depends upon such a happenstance - as whether one escapes or not - ultimately would not be worth living at all.\u0026rdquo;\nAt any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence. [\u0026hellip;] the person who attacks the problems of life actively is like a man who removes each successive leaf from his calendar and files it neatly and carefully away with its predecessors, after first having jotted down a few diary notes on the back. He can reflect with pride and joy on all the richness set down in these notes, on all the life he has already lived to the fullest.\n\u0026ldquo;anticipatory anxiety\u0026rdquo; - fear causes what one is afraid of.\n\u0026ldquo;hyper-intention\u0026rdquo; - forced intention makes impossible what one forcibly wishes.\n\u0026ldquo;hyper-reflection\u0026rdquo; - excessive attention on oneself, and not on others, resulting in inability to achieve meaningful relationships, etc.\n\u0026ldquo;paradoxical intention\u0026rdquo; - intend for a moment precisely what he fears. e.g. excessive sweating caused by meeting someone - challenge yourself to sweat even more.\n"}]
